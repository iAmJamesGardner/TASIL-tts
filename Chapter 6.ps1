MyNarrator "Claire's announcement sent a shock wave across the room, making everyone gasp in extreme surprise! Everyone thought that ClaireWilson must be out of her mind! It was the worst time to stand under the limelight now! Other than failing miserably, there was nothing else she could achieve! Emgrand Group was the largest company in Aurous Hill and the Wilson family was nothing more than an insignificant ant to them! Whoever took the challenge would only end up failing!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
HaroldWilson "Claire, do you really think that you can get a deal from Emgrand Group?" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
WendyWilson "Claire, who do you think you are? What do you think Emgrand Group is? You being so reckless and irrational will only humiliate the Wilson family!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
MyNarrator "Someone else added," -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
Bystander "Wendy is right! If she is kicked out by Emgrand Group, our family will be a laughing stock in Aurous Hill!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
MyNarrator "Blood rushed to Claire's face and she felt burning embarrassment. Her status in the family had plummeted since she married Charlie. Not only did the family members ignore her and elbow her aside, they also derided her parents. She felt that if she could strike that deal with Emgrand Group, she could consolidate her position in the family. The most important thing was that her parents could stand tall and be proud of who they were. But under the sarcastic comments and condemnation, she wanted to withdraw from her silly idea. She glared at Charlie in annoyance. How did he bewitch her and why did she listen to him? She shouldn't have made such a silly suggestion in the first place… Lady Wilson was furious as she listened to the verbal exchanges. No one dared accept the task after she asked several times. Now that Claire courageously stood up to take the challenge, these people started ridiculing her! Lady Wilson had always disliked Claire, but at this moment she was glad that Claire was at least willing to walk the impossible line, unlike the rest of the members who were only good at giving her trouble—especially her favorite grandson, Harold! He was such a disappointment!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
LadyWilson "Stop your nonsense, you cowards! I'll pass the task of striking a deal with Emgrand Group to Claire!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
ClaireWilson "Don't worry, Grandma, I'll try my best." -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
HaroldWilson "You try your best, and then what? You'll embarrass us when you fail later!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
CharlieWade "Harold, why do you taunt Claire like that? Do you think the Wilson family is not qualified to collaborate with Emgrand Group?" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
HaroldWilson "No, I don't mean it like that. I just think it is impossible for Claire to strike the deal! That's all!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
CharlieWade "What if she succeeds? Should we make a bet?" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
HaroldWilson "Okay, let's bet then! Do you think I'm scared of your little threat? What do you want to bet? Let's hear you out." -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
CharlieWade "If Claire succeeds, you will grovel at my feet and admit that you're wrong in front of everyone. If she fails, I will grovel at your feet and admit that I'm wrong. What do you think?" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
HaroldWilson "Hahaha! You're really digging your own grave, loser! Alright, I'll take the bet!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
CharlieWade "Everyone, all of you are our witnesses. Whoever goes back on the bet will have his father, mother, grandpa, and grandma die!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
MyNarrator "Harold wouldn't dare renege after such a statement. To do so would be to curse his grandmother, Lady Wilson, to die—and Lady would not let him off the hook." -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
HaroldWilson "Everyone, you'll be my witness. I'll wait for you to kneel before me!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
MyNarrator "Claire was startled by the entire event and kept signaling to Charlie with her eyes, but he turned a blind eye. Lady Wilson couldn't care less about the bet. Her only concern was whether the Wilson Group could land a spot on Emgrand Group's collaboration list. If the deal went through, she wouldn't even mind if Harold called Charlie ‘daddy,' let alone knelt before him." -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
LadyWilson "Okay, that's all for today. Claire, you have three days to negotiate and strike the deal. Dismissed!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
MyNarrator "After returning home, Claire's parents vented their fury." -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
ElaineWilson "Claire, you're crazy! How could you listen to that loser and accept the task without thinking it through?" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
JacobWilson "Charlie, you hopeless loser—you've pushed my darling daughter right into the grave this time! If Claire fails, she will be elbowed aside by the rest of the family, and you'll have to bow to Harold like a peasant in front of everyone! My dignity will be ruined!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
CharlieWade "Dad, Mom, everything will be all right if Claire succeeds in the negotiation and strikes the deal, am I right?" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
JacobWilson "Negotiate my ass! Do you have any idea how powerful Emgrand Group is? They won't even bat an eye at the mediocre Wilson family!" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
CharlieWade "Maybe someone will bat an eye at us—you don't know that. Honestly, I have confidence in Claire; I think she'll strike the deal easily." -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
ElaineWilson "You think? Who are you—do you think you're the owner of Emgrand Group? You're nothing but a loser, a piece of trash. How dare you be so ignorant and confident?" -OutputFile ".\Chapter 6 Audio\TASIL-$i.mp3"
